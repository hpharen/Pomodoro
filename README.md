# Pomodoro Redesign
The redesigned **Pomodoro** app focuses on enhancing usability through a series of interface and interaction improvements. The **start/stop functionality** was streamlined into a single button with intuitive play/pause icons, addressing the confusion from ambiguous button states. **Progressive disclosure** was applied by hiding the "How to" section until the user scrolls, reducing cognitive overload. **UI consistency** was reinforced using open-source frameworks, a unified font and color scheme, and simplified menus to eliminate nesting and repetitive confirmations. **Working memory** was supported through automatic Pomodoro cycle tracking, visual progress indicators, and persistent task lists. **Affordances** were clarified with universal icons, urgency-indicating visuals, and constrained input ranges. **Invalid actions** were prevented with disabled buttons and contextual controls. **Mapping** between functions and controls was made explicit through labeled modes and color coding. The app now allows **timer customization**, manual break overrides, and theme toggles for better user control. **Feedback systems** were strengthened via auditory, visual, and real-time updates, while **key functions** were made prominent following *Fittsâ€™ Law*. The design adheres to the **80/20 rule** by prioritizing the timer and simplifying secondary features. Lastly, **visibility and representation** were enhanced using dual time displays, animated transitions, and a clear visual hierarchy to ensure the system status and functions are always evident.
