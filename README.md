# Pomodoro Redesign
### Fixing Gulf of Evaluation:
- **Issue**:  
  User is able to press "Start" when the timer is running and "Stop" when the timer is paused. They are unaware of the states of the buttons.
- **Improvement**:  
  - The "Start" button is disabled and greyed out when the timer is running.  
  - The "Stop" button is disabled and greyed out when the timer is paused.  

### Adding Progressive Disclosure:
- **Issue**:  
  The user can see the "How to" section along with the timer, which may overload them with too much information for a very simple app.
- **Improvement**:  
  - When the website is loaded, only the timer section is visible.  
  - The "How to" section is shown only when scrolling down.
